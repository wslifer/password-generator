This is a password generator that will prompt the user several times to figure out how long a password should be, and whether or not to use each type of character. 

With this generator passwords must be 8 to 128 characters long and the user must select one type of character in order for the functions to work. If the user does not select a value in between 8 or 128 and/or doesn't select at least one type of character and error message will display to alert them they must select something within the parameters of the functions.
